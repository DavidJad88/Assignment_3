#Semester assignment, Kristiania University college, autumn 2024.
##Exercise in creating a quiz, rendering questions using JS, and storing information to be displayed.

Managed to have the site display the quiz container and render the questions from the array on press start.

issues i had to resort to gpt for:
-formulation on which question in questionsarray was to be rendered, i.e currenQuestionIndex
-rendering the correct answer button, having the button be toggled, and subsequently enabling next button click
-rendering the reviewpage to process the indexes retrieved from the answers, and turning it into text to be displayed.
